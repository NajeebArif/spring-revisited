# Spring Revisited

A very simple application to demonstrate various plumbing features of a Microservice architecture.

# Stuffs which can be found here:
1)Spring boot based microservices services
2)Spring cloud config (centralized config server)
3)Spring cloud eureka (service discovery and registry)

# The project is not dockerized yet but they will be soon enough.
